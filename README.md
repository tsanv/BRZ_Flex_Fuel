# BRZ / GT86 / FRS Flex Fuel

## Project

DIY flex fuel for BRZ / GT86 / FRS, which uses a 0.96 oled display screen.
I wanted to create my own flex fuel kit without paying over $500 dollars to just run E85. Also, I wanted to be able to show different animations / pictures on the oled screen for fun.




## Disclaimer & Background
This is a work in progress and has not been yet fully tested! I only wanted to try this for fun and I will be placing this into my BRZ. There are many forums out there that have done a DIY flex fuel kit.

## Demo

## How does it work?
Using a fuel sensor, we can collect the fuel content and send this signal to the ecu via O2 sensor.
